focus on the intent of the code and work together with a minimum of friction.

## Need of Guidelines

These Python Guidelines provides context to the developers who are new to the
codebase and wishes to make any real-world contribution with
`org:creativecommons` and be a part of the organization and learn new things
with the organization.

## Code Formatting

### Overview

All Python code must be formatted using [Black][black], *the uncompromising
Python code formatter*. Each project should contain a `pyproject.toml`
configuration file that limits line length to 79 characters.

[black]: https://github.com/psf/black

### Examples

- Black configuration (`pyproject.toml`): [GitHub Search · org:creativecommons
  filename:pyproject.toml][blackconfig]
- GitHub Actions workflow: [GitHub Search · org:creativecommons "pipenv run
  black"][blackactions]

[blackconfig]: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acreativecommons+filename:pyproject.toml
[blackactions]: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acreativecommons+%22pipenv+run+black%22&type=code


## Style and Quality

### Overview

All Python code must be checked using [flake8][flake8], *a python tool that
glues together pep8, pyflakes, mccabe, and third-party plugins to check
the style and quality of some python code.*

[flake8]: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8

###  Conflicts with Black

Where flake8 conflicts with Black, the flake8 check should be skipped. For
example, there are instances where black formats code that generates flake8
warning for [Whitespace before ':' (E203)][e203].

[e203]: https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E203.html


### Examples

- flake8 configuration (`.flake8`): [GitHub Search · org:creativecommons
  filename:.flake8][flake8conf]
- flake8 skip E203 warning: [GitHub Search · org:creativecommons "noqa:
  E203"][skipe203]
- GitHub Actions workflow: [GitHub Search · org:creativecommons "pipenv run
  flake8"][flake8actions]

[flake8conf]: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acreativecommons+filename:.flake8
[skipe203]: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acreativecommons+%22noqa%3A+E203%22&type=code
[flake8actions]: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acreativecommons+%22pipenv+run+flake8%22&type=code

## Handling Imports

### Overview

All the imports in the Python code must be done via [isort][isort], a Python
utility/library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated
into sections and by type.
It provides a command line utility, Python library and
[plugins for various editors](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/wiki/isort-Plugins)
to quickly sort all your imports. It requires Python 3.6+ to run but
supports formatting Python 2 code too.

[isort]: https://github.com/pycqa/isort


### Configuration

There's a good `isort` config which one should follow while contributing
in the Python projects of the creativecommons. These configurations should
 be a part of `pyproject.toml` labelled as `[tools.isort]`

- Isort Configuration (`pyproject.toml`): [GitHub Search · org:creativecommons
filename:pyproject.toml][isortconfig]

[isortconfig]: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acreativecommons+filename:pyproject.toml


## Development Environment

### Overview

Please work to minimize the number of development related technologies. This
helps minimize the overhead of contributing to multiple projects. Most of our
projects use either [Pipenv][pipenv], *the Python Development Workflow for
Humans,* or [docker-compose][dockercompose], *a tool for defining and running
multi-container Docker applications.*

[pipenv]: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv
[dockercompose]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/


### Examples

- Pipenv configuration: [GitHub Search · org:creativecommons
  filename:Pipfile][pipenvconf]
- Docker-compose example: [docker-compose.yml for cccatalog][dockercomposeconf]
  and the [related README.md][relatedreadme]

[pipenvconf]: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acreativecommons+filename:Pipfile
[dockercomposeconf]: https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog/blob/master/src/cc_catalog_airflow/docker-compose.yml
[relatedreadme]: https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog#development-setup-for-airflow-and-api-puller-scripts


## Additional Guidance

Thankfully, Black removes a lot of style work and worry. Where there is room
for developer discretion, the following guides are excellent resources:

- [Google Python Style Guide][googlestyle]
- [Code Style — The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python][hitchhikers]
